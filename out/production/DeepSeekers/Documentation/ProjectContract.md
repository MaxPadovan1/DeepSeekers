# Project Contract
- Our weekly meeting is scheduled on Tuesday mornings at 11am.
- Atleast try to attend the meeting online so that we can keep up with the project every week and  be prepared for our classes on Thursdays.
- Inform the team members earlier on, if you are not able to attend any meetings or classes.
- If you feel like any one of the team member is lacking, try talking out with them and helping them if possible. If you find a team member to be uninterested, discuss on the features that could be avoided, while maintaining the quality of the project.
