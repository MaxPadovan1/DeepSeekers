## What Went Well
- Everyone is actively working on the project.
- We have good communication and hold team meetings weekly.
- Tasks are assigned based on each person's strengths.
- Team members are supportive — problems are discussed and solved collaboratively.
- After several discussions, we created both low fidelity and medium fidelity UI designs.
- The resulting UI pages are clean and highly usable.

## What Didn't Go Well
- Some team members occasionally forgot to start tasks due to schedule clashes or other commitments.
- Tasks were sometimes only picked up after someone followed up.

## Appreciations
- Thanks to every team member for contributing to the project.
- Everyone is an integral part of the team.
